## [782. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones)

### Easy

You are given two strings, `jewels` representing the types of jewels and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` represents the type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are jewels.

Letters are case-sensitive, so `&quot;a&quot;` is considered a different type of stone than `&quot;A&quot;`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
**Input:** jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
**Output:** 3
```**Example 2:**

```
**Input:** jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
**Output:** 0
```
 

**Constraints:**

- ```1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50```
- ```jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.``
- All characters in `jewels` are **unique**.
